# _Calorie Counter App, Angular 2_

#### _Code Review Week 2 of Epicodus Javascript, Angular 2 App, 3.19.2016_

### By _**Joseph Karasek**_

## Description

_This web app is designed to track food intake by listing food items along with calories and notes about each food. A user can create a new entry, see a list of entries, see details for any given entry, and edit those details. The user can also filter the list of entries they are viewing. The app preloads a list of entries for demonstration purposes (no database connected). This app was built using the Angular 2 beta._

_The goal of this project is to show competency with node.js, gulp, dependency management, TypeScript, and Angular 2._

_The code will be reviewed with the following criteria:_

* _Does the website work as expected?_
* _Is the app structured in a logical way, including a model, multiple components and TypeScript syntax? Interfaces are not a requirement for this assignment._
* _Does the app allow you to create and edit new instances of a model?_
* _Does the app allow you to view a list of foods names and then see the other properties in a details view on click?_
* _Does the app allow you to filter foods based on their calories?_
* _Do you manage your build tool dependencies with npm?_
* _Do you manage your front-end dependencies with Bower?_
* _Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server? Does the asset pipeline include all tasks from the homework this week?_
* _Does the code stick to standards from previous weeks? (Testing is not required this week.)_
* _Are you able to discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology?_
